          <h1>Alexis Bruneau</h1>         

          <p>Hello, my name is Alexis Bruneau, I am currently at the University of Toronto doing a Master of Engineering. 
          My program is Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis on robotics and analytics, and my interests are the following:
          machine learning,  AI applications in robotics, data science, and data analytics.           
          </p>


          <p>One of my skills is to learn new concepts quickly. Throughout my jobs, I used 
           Python, SQL, and Power BI to do data analysis. I also used UiPath to automate processes, and I dabbled a bit in web development using .Net framework. I also 
           learned different lean six sigma techniques to improve processes.   
          </p>

          <p>I am excited to learn new skills and apply them to projects related to my interests. On this webpage, I will update projects that I'll be working on throughout the year.
          </p>
